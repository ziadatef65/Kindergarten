# Kindergarten Educational App

The app allows children to watch educational videos and participate in quizzes at the end of each course. The quizzes are designed to test their understanding of the concepts covered in the videos. An artificial intelligence model is used to evaluate their answers and determine whether they are correct or incorrect.

# Features

- Quizzes to reinforce learning and assess comprehension.
- Artificial intelligence model to evaluate quiz answers.
